This project looks at lease buyout agreements in San Francisco for the time period 2015-2019. The visualizations allow exploration and comparison of trends between San Francisco zip codes and neighborhoods.<br><br>

Buyout agreements are a method by which landlords incentivize tenants to vacate their rental units by offering a lump sum payment in exchange.<br><br>

There could be a number of reasons why landlords would want to get their tenants out, so here is a simple example: a resident of San Francisco has been living in a home since the 70s. This home is rent-controlled, meaning there is a maximum amount landlords can charge rent. The landlord realizes they could be making more money if they get the tenant out and establish a new renting amount or maybe even sell the property. They try to give the tenant $50.000 to leave. Their approach on how to go about this can vary. <br><br>

Unfortunately, these arrangements can become a form of tenant abuse and intimidiation. For this reason, there has been a new rule introduced recently, where each buyout is to be reported to the San Francisco Rent Board, which has not been recording all the transactions [<a href="https://sfrb.org/379e-tenant-buyout-agreements">37.9E Tenant Buyout Agreements</a>].<br><br>

This is an exploratory visualization that intends to provide more transparency in regards to this issue.
