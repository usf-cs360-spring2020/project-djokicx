This project looks at lease buyout agreements in San Francisco for the time period 2015-2019. The visualizations allow exploration and comparison of trends between San Francisco zip codes and neighborhoods.<br><br>

Buyout agreements are a method by which landlords incentivize tenants to vacate their rental units by offering a lump sum payment in exchange.<br><br>

Unfortunately, these arrangements can become a form of tenant abuse and intimidiation. For this reason, there has been a new rule introduced recently, where each buyout is to be reported to the San Francisco Rent Board, which has not been recording all the transactions [<a href="https://sfrb.org/379e-tenant-buyout-agreements">37.9E Tenant Buyout Agreements</a>].<br><br>

This is an exploratory visualization that intends to provide more transparency in regards to this issue.
