<p>The intention is to perhaps merge the two maps and be able to display each buyout agreement that occured in the San Francisco for the past five years. The questions I am trying to explore:</p>

<h3 id="interactivity">Interactivity</h3>

<p>On-demand details for <em>each buyout point</em> displaying address, buyout amount, number of tenants, how it compares to average buyout amount in the zip and how it compares to average buyout amount for the entire city.</p>

<ol>
  <li>Where are the buyouts happening, which areas of the city? <em>Answer</em>: The central parts of the city and Mission district</li>
  <li>How does the buyout compare to others? <em>Answer</em>: Depends</li>
</ol>

<h2 id="tree">Tree</h2>

<p>The tree map breaks down the data by neighborhood. The questions I am trying to explore:</p>

<ol>
  <li>What city neighborhoods have the highest cumulative buyout amount? Mission, Outer Richmond, Castro/Upper Market &amp; Tenderloin</li>
  <li>How neighborhoods compare to one another in terms of buyouts? <em>Answer</em>: Depends</li>
</ol>

<h3 id="interactivity-1">Interactivity</h3>

<p>Finally, I am thinking of including a linechart per each neighborhood. The line chart would be an interactive piece of the treemap - when a neighborhood is hovered, I would display a time chart of buyout trends. The questions I am trying to explore:</p>

<ol>
  <li>What are the buyout trends for the specific neighborhood? <em>Answer</em>: Depends</li>
  <li>How are the buyout amounts changing? <em>Answer</em>: Depends</li>
  <li>How is the number of buyouts changing? <em>Answer</em>: Depends</li>
</ol>

<p>Note: This prototype is across the entire dataset</p>
