## Overview

The following datasets were used to calculate the population of each San Francisco neighborhood:

* Census 2020 Tracts for San Francisco
* Analysis Neighborhoods
* Census 2020 Tracts for San Francisco

The numbers were acumulated by associating each neighborhood with census tract and then summing up census data for each tract.

As for **Buyout Agreements** dataset, each row represents a transaction, a particular buyout agreement.

Columns of interest in this dataset were:

* _Buyout Agreement Date_
* _Address_
* _Number of Tenants_
* _Buyout Amount_
* _Longitude_
* _Latitude_

This dataset is somewhat incomplete and is often missing feild such as _Buyout Amount_ and _Buyout Agreement Date_. I tried to account for that in the visualizations.

The dataset includes values for the time period 2015-2019 (inclusive).

I used this dataset in combination with the derived population dataset to calculate the following neighborhood specific values:

* **total_amount** - the total amount in buyout agreement transactions
* **amount_per_capita** - total amount divided by the population size for that neighborhood
* **average_buyout_amount** - average buyout agreement amount across the entire timeperiod
* **full_info_count** - the number of buyout agreement transactions that have fully available data

Additionally, I calculated year-specific statistics.

You can find the full dataset in .json format [dataset](../data/stats.json).
